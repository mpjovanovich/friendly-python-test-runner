- Deploy to VSE
- Create client calling code; pass in test suite name as arg
- The case where inputs are being passed to the program and are not consumed is not being handled. You can have a "pass" case that's really not a pass in this scenario.
  - I think we can just check if the end of the output is the last input that was passed it; it seems to be appended to the end of the program output.
